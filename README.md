# Stock-Trading-App

This project was developed as part of my CSCI 571 Web Technologies course in my Masters program. 
I got a chance to learn and develop a cool Stocks trading app in Android. 

- The app enables users to search for different stock symbols, look for detailed
information and historical charts about them using Tiingo API, and also view the latest news about the company.

- Users can trade with virtual money and create a portfolio, with information stored in a local storage, and also favorite stock
symbols to track their stock prices.

- Used third party libraries like Glide for image caching and Volley for making HTTP requests.

I will be rolling out an APK for anyone to use it soon. 

The backend is written in Node.js and is hosted on https://akansha-hw9-backend.wm.r.appspot.com
A sample endpoint is https://akansha-hw9-backend.wm.r.appspot.com/news?term=msft  

For now, this video explains how the app functions and looks:
